This repository contains all of my electronics designs made in KiCad. KiCad is an open source software that allows you to design electronics schematics and PCB layouts.

For PCB etching, I print the PCB files on glossy paper using a laser printer. Depending on the board, they might be printed mirrored or not. Pay close attention to what pins go where before etching.

Once I have the PCB layout printed, I place the paper on a single sided, copper clad PCB blank and tape it in place with masking tape. Then I use an iron on a high setting (usually cotton or higher) and iron the board side (e.g. paper down on a flat surface) for a few minutes. Then I place the entire thing (paper and board) under cold water for several minutes until the water seeps through the paper enough to break down and peel away.

Then I use an Exacto knife to remove any toner that bled to where I dont want it (sometimes the iron squeezes it and traces are too close together). And I use a fine-tipped permanent marker to repair any areas where the toner peeled off with the paper.

Once Im happy with how everything looks, I make a mixture of 2 parts white vinegar (5% acidity), 1 part Hydrogen Peroxide (%3) and a dash of NON-IODIZED salt. I stir the chemicals until the salt dissolves.

Then I drop the cooper clad board into the mixture and agitate it for 15-20 minutes until the unwanted copper is gone. The chemicals will turn a light blue/turquoise color as they dissolve the copper. 

A good way to tell if the etching is complete is to pull it out of the etchant and hold it up to a light. You will be able to see the traces through the back side of the board.

Rinse off the etchant and then use acetone to remove the toner. As you do, you will see copper traces where the toner used to be.

Next, drill any through holes with a 0.1mm drill bit. I have to use a drill press because my hands aren't steady enough and I end up breaking drill bits.

Finally, place the electronics through the holes from the back side and solder the pins on the side with copper traces.

Because copper will continue to oxidize, you may want to consider using some lacquer fingernail polish over the traces to protect them from the open air.
